# MNIST Digit Classifier with PyTorch & Gradio
A simple machine learning project that demonstrates how to train a neural network using PyTorch on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset and deploy an interactive user interface using Gradio.

### Features
- Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch
- Use the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits (0–9)
- Build a clean, interactive UI with Gradio for real-time predictions
- Upload or draw your own digit and see the model's prediction instantly

### Library
- PyTorch – Model building and training
- Gradio – User interface for real-time interaction
- Torchvision – Dataset utilities and image transforms
